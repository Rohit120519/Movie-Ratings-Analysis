Data analysis techniques used in the notebook include exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques such as data cleaning,
feature engineering, statistical aggregations, and data visualizations. The notebook also uses machine learning models for predictive analysis,
such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, sentiment analysis, and trend prediction.
